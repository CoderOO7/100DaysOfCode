<hr>

## Starting again after a break

### Day1: Sep 25 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Try to understand the logic.

**Thoughts:** Today thinking of shifting from Arch linux to Parrat OS to play with security tools, but unable to install it getting error on booting with usb, either download file is corrupted or may be some another issue. Spend around 3 hours on logic understanding and implementation but yet not able to make it.  


### Day2: Sep 26 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Try to understand the logic.

**Thoughts:** Today again download the new iso image of Parrot OS but getting same error. Today able to make partial logic, the issue is that on updating the particular cell on traversing the tree, unable to reset the cell to its default value. By tomorrow it will get completed.


### Day3: Sep 27 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Implement the AI logic.

**Thoughts:** After many attempts able to complete the AI logic. Even after implementing the minimax algo part, the issue was that computer first move on ticTacToe board take around a minute to do calculation, to fix that manually optimize the first move by either computer mark in center of board or at top most left corner. 


### Day4: Sep 28 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Fix one bug & little bit styling.

**Thoughts:** The project is almost completed, now the main part is left to make it responsive to play it on mobile. Today begin to work in the same company which I left, but now as a web developer. Tomorrow will implement left changes and if possible release it tomorrow. 


### Day5: Sep 29 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Add media query to make responsive layout.

**Thoughts:** Although it's now responsive and working fine, but still layout getting break on some devices b/c margin issue, the screens div don't get centered vertically on some mobile-screen and need to add hover effect on touch b/c mobile doesn't support hover pseudo selector.


### Day6: Sep 30 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Fix layout break issue on some mobile.

**Thoughts:** Now the remaining part is code documentation. Tried to implement LEVEL 4 media query to enable hover effect in mobile devices but it's not working don't know why. Tomorrow after documentation will create a pull request and begin to move forward on my JS-track. Also read about CORS policy, its now annoying me.

**Resources:**

https://web.dev/cross-origin-resource-sharing/


### Day7: Oct 1 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Document the code.

**Thoughts:** So the project is completed but not created a pull request yet, will create it tomorrow.


### Day8: Oct 2 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Today done remaining code-documentation and read about classes in javascript.

**Thoughts:** In js classes are only for presentation to user so it depict the feature of ObjectOriented language. Under the hood its prototypal inheritance. Apart from that add demo gif to project directory first time.

**Resources:**

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/classes


### Day9: Oct 3 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Today learn to setup webpack bundler.

**Thoughts:** Read about ES6 modules & module patterns. Learn to setup webpack bundler with basic configuration. The advantage of using webpack is that it support multiple type of files i.e css,txt. Based on type different loaders are used to bundle them and begin a new project a *restaurant-page*.

**Resources:**

### Day 10: Oct 4 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Today started react-intermediate course.

**Thoughts:** So started this course to cover some left concept like react-redux ,ssr and also to revise previous concepts related to hooks.

**Resources:**

https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v2/


### Day 11: Oct 5 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** useRef hook.

**Thoughts:** Today understand the purpose of userRef hook, basically when you want to state change of variable without rendering the dom, in that case useRef.

**Resources:**

https://ui.dev/useref/


### Day 12: Oct 6 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** useReducer, useMemo,useCallback, useImperativeHandle & useLayoutEffect.

**Thoughts:** So basically these are as follows:

1. **useReducer:** It allow to group similar action in one function that change a state. For example: having two button change one increment the count, other decrement the count, thus count is state where changing its value is similar action.

1. **useMemo, useCallback:** For optimization purpose, should be used rarely.

1. **useImperativeHandle:** Allow to pass props from child to parent.

1. **useLayoutEffect:** Similar to useEffect instead it call after render but before the screen is updated.


### Day 13: Oct 7 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Contribute to opensource project issues.

**Thoughts:** So today first time I actually contributed to issues of open source projects, but don't know the maintainer will accept the PR or not. Learned to load google-fonts asynchronously to prevent render blocking and preconnect allow to perform dns request and total round-trip time to make successful connection b/w client & host before any resource fetch. Thus decrease latency of network and fetch resources fast.

### Day 14: Oct 8 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Learn about code-splitting concept in React.

**Thoughts:** So if you have a component that is greater than 30KB then we should load that Component dynamically using lazy module provided by react library.
It load the module dynamically. Apart from that create a PR in Android-dev-resources repository.


### Day 15: Oct 9 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Learn to perfom Server Side Rendering in nodejs.

**Thoughts:** react-dom/server library provide two API renderToString & renderToNodeStream that take your react component as input and convert it to html and this html is send as response to browser. So basically all rendering part is done on server side. Keeping it all aside, today I learn to integrate i3-gaps wm with MATE desktop environment in Parrot OS. 

**Resources:**

### Day 16: Oct 10 2020 (Saturday)
