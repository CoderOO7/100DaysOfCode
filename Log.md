<hr>

## Starting again after a break

### Day1: Sep 25 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Try to understand the logic.

**Thoughts:** Today thinking of shifting from Arch linux to Parrat OS to play with security tools, but unable to install it getting error on booting with usb, either download file is corrupted or may be some another issue. Spend around 3 hours on logic understanding and implementation but yet not able to make it.


### Day2: Sep 26 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Try to understand the logic.

**Thoughts:** Today again download the new iso image of Parrot OS but getting same error. Today able to make partial logic, the issue is that on updating the particular cell on traversing the tree, unable to reset the cell to its default value. By tomorrow it will get completed.


### Day3: Sep 27 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Implement the AI logic.

**Thoughts:** After many attempts able to complete the AI logic. Even after implementing the minimax algo part, the issue was that computer first move on ticTacToe board take around a minute to do calculation, to fix that manually optimize the first move by either computer mark in center of board or at top most left corner.


### Day4: Sep 28 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Fix one bug & little bit styling.

**Thoughts:** The project is almost completed, now the main part is left to make it responsive to play it on mobile. Today begin to work in the same company which I left, but now as a web developer. Tomorrow will implement left changes and if possible release it tomorrow.


### Day5: Sep 29 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Add media query to make responsive layout.

**Thoughts:** Although it's now responsive and working fine, but still layout getting break on some devices b/c margin issue, the screens div don't get centered vertically on some mobile-screen and need to add hover effect on touch b/c mobile doesn't support hover pseudo selector.


### Day6: Sep 30 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Fix layout break issue on some mobile.

**Thoughts:** Now the remaining part is code documentation. Tried to implement LEVEL 4 media query to enable hover effect in mobile devices but it's not working don't know why. Tomorrow after documentation will create a pull request and begin to move forward on my JS-track. Also read about CORS policy, its now annoying me.

**Resources:**

https://web.dev/cross-origin-resource-sharing/


### Day7: Oct 1 2020 (Thursday)

**Thoughts:** So the project is completed but not created a pull request yet, will create it tomorrow.


### Day8: Oct 2 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Today done remaining code-documentation and read about classes in javascript.

**Thoughts:** In js classes are only for presentation to user so it depict the feature of ObjectOriented language. Under the hood its prototypal inheritance. Apart from that add demo gif to project directory first time.

**Resources:**

### Day9: Oct 3 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Today learn to setup webpack bundler.

**Thoughts:** Read about ES6 modules & module patterns. Learn to setup webpack bundler with basic configuration. The advantage of using webpack is that it support multiple type of files i.e css,txt.

**Thoughts:** Today understand the purpose of userRef hook, basically when you want to state change of variable without rendering the dom, in that case useRef.

**Resources:**

https://ui.dev/useref/


### Day 12: Oct 6 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** useReducer, useMemo,useCallback, useImperativeHandle & useLayoutEffect.

**Thoughts:** So basically these are as follows:

1. **useReducer:** It allow to group similar action in one function that change a state. For example: having two button change one increment the count, other decrement the count, thus count is state where changing its value is similar action.

1. **useMemo, useCallback:** For optimization purpose, should be used rarely.

1. **useImperativeHandle:** Allow to pass props from child to parent.

1. **useLayoutEffect:** Similar to useEffect instead it call after render but before the screen is updated.


### Day 13: Oct 7 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Contribute to opensource project issues.

**Thoughts:** So today first time I actually contributed to issues of open source projects, but don't know the maintainer will accept the PR or not. Learned to load google-fonts asynchronously to prevent render blocking and preconnect allow to perform dns request and total round-trip time to make successful connection b/w client & host before any resource fetch. Thus decrease latency of network and fetch resources fast.

### Day 14: Oct 8 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Learn about code-splitting concept in React.

**Thoughts:** So if you have a component that is greater than 30KB then we should load that Component dynamically using lazy module provided by react library.
It load the module dynamically. Apart from that create a PR in Android-dev-resources repository.


### Day 15: Oct 9 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Learn to perfom Server Side Rendering in nodejs.

**Thoughts:** react-dom/server library provide two API renderToString & renderToNodeStream that take your react component as input and convert it to html and this html is send as response to browser. So basically all rendering part is done on server side. Keeping it all aside, today I learn to integrate i3-gaps wm with MATE desktop environment in Parrot OS.

**Resources:**

### Day 16: Oct 10 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Restaurant-Page project.

**Thoughts:** Only setup basic structure, will implement scss in this project. Hopyfully that project should be completed by tomorrow.

### Day 17: Oct 11 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Restaurant-Page project.

**Thoughts:** Today basically add content to Home and Contact tab logic. Proper UI and other tabs content implementation yet remain.

### Day 18: Oct 12 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Restaurant-Page project.

**Thoughts:** Now only menu page need to be edited and some remaining functionality will complete it by tomorrow.

### Day 19: Oct 13 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Restaurant-Page project.

**Thoughts:** I know I had to complete it by today but some changes left like responsive navbar, Ui changes of contact page and few layout break issue.


### Day 20: Oct 14 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Restaurant-Page project.

**Thoughts:** Today was busy in some other stuff but work on making my navbar responsive and few UI modifications. Now the issue that was remain is Menu tab layout get break on mobile devices need to fix that.

### Day 21: Oct 15 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Restaurant-Page project.

**Thoughts:** Fix the Menu tab layout break issue. The problem was that when using `gap:5%` property in then it overflow the content from parent div. It's because `grid-template-columns: repeat(autofill, 50vh)` have column width in `vh` and I was using `%` in gap property. When fixing that learn about `vmin` vs `vh`. So basically if you want your layout height/width responsive to desktop & mobile devices then use `vmin`,it allow to automatically scale layout dimensions according to device.


### Day 22: Oct 16 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Restaurant-Page project.

**Thoughts:** Today completed the project, host it on github, done remaining code documentation and bla bla bla. About today I had learned concept of submodules/subtree in github. Basically to host github pages, the index.html file should be present in root of repo. If your index.html file is present in sub-folders then you can host that sub-folder on gh-pages branch.

### Day 23: Oct 17 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Today setup LAMP stack.

**Thoughts:** So today I had setup LAMP stack for php dev environment. Installation part is easy but setting up apache server to host multiple virtual domain is not fizzy task to do. Better alternative is to use XAMPP stack basically it provide all the tool in one application, instead of downloading each tool of stack and then integrate them.

### Day 2: Nov 26, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today Progress:** Begin to work on todo-list project

**Thoughts:** Today started late but cover up some concepts related to `SOLID principles` in OOPs. I only able to grab `S- Single Responsibility Principle` which means learn to break the code in small modules as much as you can, each module should independently perform its task. While setting up webpack around 2 hours gone to fix bug. Also doing side project `ciBlog` which I need to complete.

### Day 3: Nov 27, 2020 (Friday)

**Today Progress:** Some basic layout design

### Day5: Nov 29, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Add dropdown menu in sidenav.

**Thoughts:** I know I have to fix the sidenav layout break issue but it's giving me headache, not able to understand the reason so today I move forward to implement the new functionality i.e. dropdown menu and it's get done after debugging the css.

### Day6: Nov 30, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Fix sidebarnav layout bug.

**Thoughts:** So today I was working on another Django project assigned to me which I have to complete within given time period, it should be get completed. B/c that today only spend 2-3 hours on this. But it get fixed that's the big advantage of the day.


### Day7: Dec 1, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Today worked on djnago project.

**Thoughts:** So today I was working on the Django project and as I have time management issues I not able to give one hour on `todo-list` project on which I had to consistently working. So somehow got some projects. In Django project today learn to render images from db to home page.

### Day 8: Dec 2, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Reason:** Because not able to maintain the continuity on the full stack developer track I'm following.

### Day 0: Dec 3, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Perform UI changes in todo-list project.

**Thought's:** While working on the ui get to know about new term i.e `aria web standards for accessibility` don't know much about it. But it's quite handy to use allow to use css property on element in more user friendly way in terms of logic and main purpose of this is to add meaning to non-semantics so that screen reader can understand them bla bla..... Now form tomorrow will try to implement the code logic using SOLID design pattern.

### Day 3: Dec 6, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Done code refactoring

**Thought's:** Today didn't done much, spent time in doing code refactoring and then implement the left portion to render the to-do task to page dynamically.

### Day 4: Dec7, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** A holiday.

**Thought's:** So today I hadn't done anything, watched some movies and as you know I didn't code at all so will begin this challenge again. But movies are awesome.

<hr>

# Let's begin this journey again with aim to not stop until this challenge get completed.


### Day 0: Dec8, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Try to understand SOLID principles more accurately.

**Thought's:** So SOLID principles summary is like this:
- `S- Single Responsibility Principle`: A class or function should perform only one task, now that doesn't mean that an object of class will have only behaviour it can have multiple behaviour but all should be related to only one task.

- `O- Open Closed Principle`: In short, open to extension and closed to modification means in code new feature can be added without modifying existing code.

- `L- Liskov Substitution Principle`: It follows the `Open Closed Principle` in hierarchy of classes/modules where inheritance occur. One thumb rule is adding new functionality should bot modify base class code.

- `I- Interface Segregation`: Simple concept *eat according to your body requirement*. Means Classes that implements interface should not force to implement methods they don't use.

- `D- Dependency Inversion Principle`: Means your high level code should not depend on low level code. Reason is that if changes occur in low level code then changes need to be done in high level code also.
Solution is to to inject the dependency in high level class/code.

### Day1: Dec 9,2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Working on designing the code pattern for todo-app.

**Thought:** So today I had spent my most of the time in thinking about coding and non-coding related stuff. Then began to work on the project in which I have some issue in design the good code pattern for my todo-app. Well working on that will design the code in different way.


### Day 2: Dec 10,2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Practice previos JS concept.

**Thought:** Unlike yesterday today I was little bit busy in doing some other work because of which not properly able to give time on project but today practice previous JavaScript concept like factor function, closure etc. And working on app code design also.


### Day 3: Dec 11,2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on creating modules for todo-app.

**Thought:** Like past three days today also not able to make the app to work according to the code pattern I'm trying to follow. But working that may be by tomorrow it should get complete.


### Day 4: Dec 12,2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on creating modules for todo-app.

**Thought:** So unlike past three days today I able to create the design pattern. Now working on that module design by creating the seperate modules for all static event listener and manipulating DOM using seperate DOMStuff modules. Apart from that today came to know about `pub/sub pattern` that allow to create custom events to make code more modular by providing loose coupling between modules.

**Resouces:**
- https://css-tricks.com/build-a-state-management-system-with-vanilla-javascript/

### Day 5: Dec 13,2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Created the module pattern and basic functionality.

**Thought:** Don't know how, but now this project is taking some shape. Because the main task is to design the code pattern and that one is done, now need to add some remaining functionality and hope so this project get complete in next two days. Today learn that we can access the form input value using `name` attribute through js. Ex

 ```html
    <form id="form">
        <input type="text" name="title">
    </form>

    <script>
        const formEl = document.getElementById('form');
        const title = formEl.elements.title.value;

        console.log(title);
    </script>
 ```

**Resouces:**

### Day 6: Dec 14,2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on rendering todos based on specific projects.

**Thought:** While working on the above task get stuck on it to implement the right logic for that. Today I also start late to work on that project so only able to give around 2 and half hour.


### Day 7: Dec 15,2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on rendering todos based on specific projects.

**Thought:** Now rendering part is done for todos. Other remaining functionality is edit,delete todos and apply filters to render them like weekdays,today or all todos at once. Will complete it by tomorrow. Also today learn the difference between `event.target and event.currentTarget.`

- event.target also return the reference to children of parentNode at which  event listener is initialize.
- event.currentTarget will only return the reference to the element at which event listener is initialize.


### Day 8: Dec 16,2020(Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on edit and delete todo's.

**Thought:** So basically now you can create,edit and delete todo's. Now small changes remain are sorting them according to duedate, filters and big task remain is to implement google firebase auth and database service. While working on this project day by day the code is becoming more complex, even though I had tried to keep it simple. Will refactor the code one's all functionality get implemented.

- Learned about a new css property that is `filter`, that may be quite handy to use if all browser support it:

```css
    main{
        filter : brightness(110%);
    }
```


### Day 9: Dec 17,2020(Thursday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on filter todo's.

**Thought:** Trying to implement filtering todo's functionaliy. In simple way it can be done by adding event listener and then rendering the DOM. But thinking about how actually sites like stackoverflow, internshala etc...filters the result when a specific tag is selected.


### Day 10: Dec 18,2020(Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on filter todo's.

**Thought:** Like yesterday stuck on this issue.But will find the way to implement it. If not then will use simple approach but it may break design pattern somehow.


### Day 11: Dec 19,2020(Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Refactor the code.

**Thought:** Today begin to work on project late because of which not able to complete the task but now got solution the filter the todo's and will complete it by tomorrow with local storage support functionality.<br>

Learn a small difference between `append vs appendChild()`.
- append() can accept DOM NODE as well as DOM String.
- appendChild() only accept DOM NODE.

```javascript
const parent = document.createElement('div');
const child = document.createElement('p');
// Appending Node Objects
parent.append(child) // Works fine
parent.appendChild(child) // Works fine
// Appending DOMStrings
parent.append('Hello world') // Works fine
parent.appendChild('Hello world') // throw error
```

### Day 12: Dec 20,2020(Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Implement todo filter logic.

**Thought:** So basically today all functionality almost completed, now need to implement local storage functionality to store web app state in client machine.

Learn about a new method of `date api` to get month name from date.

```js
    const todayTime = new Date();
    const todayMonthName = todayTime.toLocaleString('default', { month: 'long' });

    console.log(todayMonthName);
```

- https://date-fns.org/v2.16.1/docs/parseISO


### Day 13: Dec 21,2020(Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on todo-task completion logic and rendering todo-task info.

**Thought:** So basically today worked on some remaining task like functionality to complete the todo-task and allow user to view todo information in the form of modal. And perform little bit styling stuff. *Ya I know I need to create local storage, working on that one & will complete it by tomorrow.*

Also learned about a new css property to remove all default properties of element completely. Ex:

```css
    /* Old way */
    button{
        padding: 0;
        margin :0 ;
        outline: none;
        background: transparent;
    }
    /* New way */
    button{
        all: unset;
    }
```

### Day 14: Dec 22,2020(Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Implement local Storage API

**Thought:** For now todo app can work offline. Now need to add some validations and bug fixes. After that will move forward to implement firebase support for user authentication and storing user data.

Today get to know about some basic difference b/w localStorage and IndexedDB i.e.
- localStorage allow to store upto 5MB of data.
- IndexedDB allow to store maximum data according to available disk space on client device.


**Resources:**
- https://web.dev/storage-for-the-web/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43519890/what-is-the-difference-between-local-storage-and-cache-in-the-browser


### Day 15: Dec 23,2020(Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** New changes and bug fixes.

**Thought:** In yesterday commit their was a bug the items didn't get saved locally, fix that one and done some styling to make mobile responsive layout and now working on a logic to toggle the sidenav tab states to know which tab is active.

**Resources:**
- https://css-tricks.com/flexbox-truncated-text/
- https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-overflow/


### Day 16: Dec 24,2020(Thursday)

**Thought:** Today learn to add custom client-side validation to forms using `Constraint validation API`.

**Resources:**
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation
- https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/constraintvalidation/


### Day 17: Dec 25,2020(Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on logic to maintain tab states of sidenav.

**Thought:** Well I have the logic but that is wiered, so finding another nice approach to maintain tab states b/c tab state determine the which todo's to render on the screen. So about today is that no progress at all.


### Day 18 & Day 19: Dec 27,2020(Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Implement the logic to maintain tab states of sidenav.

**Thought:** So now the todo's are rendering as expected after maintaining states.


### Day 20: Dec 28,2020(Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Implement the logic to delete created projects.

**Thought:** Now my todo-app cover all functionality. Now my remaining task is to implement firebase database and authentication. Once that completed I will make a release build. Today learn about creating custom events.It's very handy if you manually need to trigger any event like click.

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events


### Day 21: Dec 29,2020(Tuesday)

**Today's Progress:** Integrate firebase sdk.

**Thought:** So today begin to integrate firesbase sdk and firestore product to enable cloud database. Most of the functionality completed working on the remaining part.


### Day 22: Dec 30,2020(Wednesday)

**Today's Progress:** Integrate firebase authentication.

**Thought:** About today is that, worked on implimenting third party provider authorization in my todo-list web app. So now user can sign-in and signout but need to sync the database to sign-in user, working on that functionaliy. After implementing that tomorrow will make a release build.

Today learn new cool css trick i.e `filter: blur(4px)` allow you to blur that element on which this property used.

### Day 24: Jan 1,2021(Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Add anonymous user login functionality in todo-list.

**Thought:** Done some minor changes in todo-list web app. Then read docs about linting your code. The main purpose of linting your code is to prevent errors in `production build`.

1. *Linting:* means following certain standard style rules for proper code formatting and syntax error prevention.
2. *Linter:* Tools that perform linting such as `eslint, babel-eslint`. These tools analyze your code and check for syntax error in code.

### Day 3: Jan 8, 2021 (Friday)

**Today's Progress:** Learn to setup eslint.

**Thought:** Today learn amazing things that to setup eslint and the most important one is to maintaining same node version across team members of a project locally. This allow to prevent production bugs for instance you as a team member install any library using higher node version and the node version running at production environment is less than your node version, than at time of making production build we have some unmet dependencies which cause bugs.

*To enforce same node and npm version locally across all team members of projcts*

> In your package.json add below line
```json
"engines": {
    "node": ">=10.0.0",
    "npm": ">=6.0.0"
  }
```

> In your .npmrc file at your project root directory add below line
```
engine-strict=true
```

### Day 4: Jan 9, 2021 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress:** Host my portfolio.

**Thought:** Today completed all the remaining functionality, use module pattern to dynamically load project list on page and some ui changes. So minimal portfolio design is completed. Now will improve it time to time.

**Demo:** https://coderoo7.github.io/portfolio


## Day 5: Jan 10, 2021 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress:** Small UI changes in my portfolio.

**Thought:** Today make a new build with small changes. Learn about `object-fit` css property, nothing else. Basically this property allow you to scale your images for different screen viewports.


## Day 6: Jan 11, 2021 (Monday)

**Today's Progress:** Learn to setup prettier with git pre-commit hook.

**Thought:** Today learn small things first of all get familiar with git pre-commit hook basically they allow to run some scripts or commands before committing the code. And about npm `--save-exact` flag to lock the version of library in pacakge.json. It prevents bugs in production environment.

> npm install --save-exact `packagename`

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "**/*": "prettier --write --ignore-unknown"
  }
}
```

>The reson of beginning this challenge again is that, yesterday I had not worked/code for at least 1hour.

**Today's Progress:** Today learn to do inline form validation using javascript and constraint validation api. Get to  know about two useful extension i.e `fakefiller - to fill mock data in form` and `iMacros - you should check out yourself.`

## Day 3: Jan 15, 2021 [Friday]

**Today's Progress:** About today is that, learn to fetch the data from server using `XMLHttpRequest` API.
One thing in which I'm confused is data always send and recieve between client and server is in the form JSON or it can be in any other form too.

## Day 4: Jan 16, 2021 [Saturday]

**Today's Progress:** Today get glimpse of promise API and learn about callback functions. Callback functions are the synchronouse/asynchronous functions that we pass as parameters in another functions. Difference between normal function and cb functions are that callback functions may or may not return immediate result while other functions always return immediately.

```javascript
// calls immediately
[1,9,1,4,7].forEach(function(num){
    console.log(num);
})

// returns result after some time in future
new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
        resolve('HI CODEROO7 here');
    },3000)
}).then(function(msg){
    console.log(msg);
})
```

### Day 0: Jan 18, 2021 [Monday]

**Today's Progress:** Today understand more deeply about callback functions synchronous and asynchronous patterns. Their are following key points that should be kept in mind while using network request.

- network request call always should be asynchronous .
- Always used ad hoc code to prevent multiple invocation of callback functions for one request.
- There may be a case when network api return response  after long time or never return, in that case there should be a functionality that automatically cancel the request after certain time.
- Also need to handle the case when network API response came early before the execution of some required code.

**Resources:**
- https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/async%20%26%20performance/ch2.md


### Day 1: Jan 19, 2021 [Tuesday]

**Today's Progress:** Today gave a glimpse to Promises chapter of YDKJS.

**Thought:** After reading able to understand few concepts that illustrate why Promises are prefer more over asynchronous callbacks for network requests.

- It prevent callback hell, make code more organised and modular.
- Promises always return an object which ensure that this object will receive future value that either be success or failure.
- Promises prevent callback trust issues like multiple invocation of callback functions.
- A Promise is immubtale once resolved or rejected means for a single request/async task, a promise will either be completed or rejected only once unlike regular callback function that can be invoke multiple times. Once promise completed no matter how many times you use `.then()` on same promise will produce same result.

Ex: Perform addition of two numbers but these number can be received immediately or in future.

**Using regular callback functions**
```js
function add(getX,getY,cb) {
	let x, y;
	getX( function(xVal){
		x = xVal;
		// both are ready?
		if (y != undefined) {
			cb( x + y );	// send along sum
		}
	} );
	getY( function(yVal){
		y = yVal;
		// both are ready?
		if (x != undefined) {
			cb( x + y );	// send along sum
		}
	} );
}

// `fetchX()` and `fetchY()` are sync or async
// functions
add( fetchX, fetchY, function(sum){
	console.log( sum ); // that was easy, huh?
} );

```
**Using Promises**

```js
function add(xPromise,yPromise) {
	// `Promise.all([ .. ])` takes an array of promises,
	// and returns a new promise that waits on them
	// all to finish
	return Promise.all( [xPromise, yPromise] )

	// when that promise is resolved, let's take the
	// received `X` and `Y` values and add them together.
	.then( function(values){
		// `values` is an array of the messages from the
		// previously resolved promises
		return values[0] + values[1];
	} );
}

// `fetchX()` and `fetchY()` return promises for
// their respective values, which may be ready
// *now* or *later*.
add( fetchX(), fetchY() )

// we get a promise back for the sum of those
// two numbers.
// now we chain-call `then(..)` to wait for the
// resolution of that returned promise.
.then( function(sum){
	console.log( sum ); // that was easier!
} );

```

### Day 2: Jan 20, 2021 [Wednesday]

**Today's Progress:** Today read about Promise Events.

**Thought:** So the question is how promise actually resolved ? Means when callback passed in `.then(cb)`, how `cb` get invok automatically ? It's simple Promise are event based objects(Not pure javascript objects like 'click' event). For instance, we register a click event on button to perform certain task.
```js
    const button = document.getElementById('#conole-btn');
    //Register click event
    button.addEventListener('click',()=>{
        console.log("Hi there, I'm console-btn !!");
        console.log("register to click event to console this msg");
    }) =
```

Like `click event` we register `.then() and .catch()` events on Promise object and passed callbacks to them to perform action when the promoise resolved.

```js

    function bar() {
        // `foo(..)` has definitely finished, so
        // do `bar(..)`'s task
    }

    function oopsBar() {
        // oops, something went wrong in `foo(..)`,
        // so `bar(..)` didn't run
    }

    // ditto for `baz()` and `oopsBaz()`

    // function that a return a promise
    function foo(x){

        //function passed in Promise api is called executor function
        return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
            // do a thing, possibly async, then…

            if (/* everything turned out fine */) {
                resolve("Stuffs Work");
            }
            else {
                reject(Error("It broke"));
            }

        });
    }

    // p is promise instance
    let p = foo( 42 );

    // Register .then() event to promise, fires when promise is resolved,
    // if promise resolved using resolve() then invoke bar cb
    // else resolved using reject() or implicit error occur by Promise executor than invoke oopsbar cb
    p.then( bar, oopsBar );

    // ditto for baz & oopsBaz cb
    p.then( baz, oopsBaz );
```

In the end you should know that promise resolved in three cases:

- When promise executor invok resolve() cb.
- When promise executor invok reject() cb.
- When Implicit error occur insde promise executor for instance.

```js
    new Promise(function(resolve, reject){

        mySpaceIsVoid() // Generate Error as this function is not defined

        resolve("Everything works fine");
    })
```


### Day 3: Jan 21, 2021 [Thursday]

**Today's Progress:** Today get familiar with i.e *Thenable Duck Typing*.

**Thought:** I don't know is it really necessary to remeber these terms but the context is that *if anything walks like a duck, quack like a duck then it must be duck*. Well it shouldn't be true always.

*Thenable Promises* are any function or objects having `.then()` method, to resemble like a Promise object. But in actual they are not Javascript Promise API instance.

```js
    let o = { then: function(){
        console.log("I'm thenable object");
    } };

    // make `v` be `[[Prototype]]`-linked to `o`
    let v = Object.create( o );

    v.someStuff = "cool";
    v.otherStuff = "not so cool";

    v.hasOwnProperty( "then" ); //return false

    // here you can say it's v object is thenable
    v.then();
```

Now we can create a utility functiuon for *duck typing check* for thenable as below but it's a ugly approach.

```js
   function isThenable (p) {

        if (
            p !== null &&
            (
                typeof p === "object" ||
                typeof p === "function"
            ) &&
            typeof p.then === "function"
        ) {
            // assume it's a thenable!
            return true;
        }
        else {
            // not a thenable
            return false;
        }
    }
```

*In short we should prevent use of `.then()` methods on objects or functions as it's not a reserved keyword in JavaScript and it may lead to bugs.*


### Day 4: Jan 22,2021 [Friday]

**Today's Progress:** Read about Promise Trust.

**Thought:** Basically all the limitations of normal callback functions are handle by Promises. These are as follows:

1. *Calling Too Early* : Means callback calls immediately/synchronously. Even if promises resolve immediately they can't be observed synchronously i.e the provided `cb` to `.then(cb)` on Promise object always invoke asynchronously.

1. *Calling Too Late* : Means some synchronous task dependent on the time in which Promise resolved. But as we know Promise always behave asynchronously i.e we can't chain some synchonous operation with Promise, so that case is invalid.

1. *Never Calling The Callback* : Promise doesn't gurantee that it will always resolved. It may be happen that promise will never resolved. To handle that case we can use utility `timeoutPromise` utility funtion with `Promise.race()` to reject the Promise ,if Promise doesn't resolve automatically within limited time.

    ```js
    // a utility for timing out a Promise
    function timeoutPromise(delay) {
        return new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
            setTimeout( function(){
                reject( "Timeout!" );
            }, delay );
        } );
    }

    // setup a timeout for `foo()`
    Promise.race( [
        foo(),					// attempt `foo()`
        timeoutPromise( 3000 )	// give it 3 seconds
    ])
    .then(
        function(){
            // `foo(..)` fulfilled in time!
        },
        function(err){
            // either `foo()` rejected, or it just
            // didn't finish in time, so inspect
            // `err` to know which
        }
    );
    ```

1. *Failing to Pass Along Any Parameters/Environment* : If we pass multiple paramaters to Promise resolution callbacks i.e `resolve()` or `reject()` then only the first paramater is passed and other paramters are ignored. To handle that case, pass an array of multiple paramaters in `resolve()` or `reject()` callbacks.

    ```js
    let p = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
                let msg1 = "CoderOO7 there ?";
                let msg2 = "How are you ?";

                //msg1 is passed to observation callback on p.then()
                //msg2 get ignored
                resolve(msg1, msg2);
            });

    p.then(function(msg1, msg2){
        console.log(msg1);
        console.log(msg2);
    })
    ```

1. *Swallowing Any Errors/Exceptions* : If any implicit error occur in the observation of resolution of Promise or explicitly reject using `reject()` cb, then Promise get rejected.

    ```js
    let p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
        foo.bar();	// `foo` is not defined, so error!
        resolve( 42 );	// never gets here :(
    });

    p.then(
        function fulfilled(){
            // never gets here :(
        },
        function rejected(err){
            // `err` will be a `TypeError` exception object
            // from the `foo.bar()` line.
        }
    );
    ```


### Day 5: Jan 23,2021 [Saturday]

**Today's Progress:** Promise Trust and async pattern.

**Thought:** As we known thenable has `.then()` method on it then how we know that promise we are using is genuine. If we call `Promise.resolve(p)` passing any promise in paramter then it will return the same promise which is `p` here in case. We can use it as a type check to know weather the promise is genuine or not.

```js
let p1 = new Promise(function(resolve){
    resolve("Success");
})

let p2 = Promise.resolve(p1);

p2 === p1 // true
```
Now consider the case of thenable.
```js
let p1 = {
    then: function(cb,errcb) {
                cb( 42 );
                errcb( "evil laugh" );
          }
};

p1
.then(
	function fulfilled(val){
		console.log( val ); // 42
	},
	function rejected(err){
		// oops, shouldn't have run
		console.log( err ); // evil laugh
	}
);

let p2 = Promise.resolve(p1);

p2 === p1 // return false
```
Now if you need to make any function behave asynchonously simply pass it in `Promise.resolve()`

### DAY 6: Jan 24,2021 [Sunday]

**Today's Progress:** Cover the topic Chain Flow in Promise.

**Thought:** We can link the multiple promises together.
- Every time we call `.then()` on Promise it will return a new promise which can be chain.
- The value return by `.then()` fullfillment callback will be passed to next chained `.then()` fullfilment callback.

    ```js
    let p1 = Promise.resolve( 21 );

    let p2 = p1.then( function(v){
        console.log( v );	// 21
        // fulfill `p2` with value `42`
        return v * 2;
    });

    // chain off `p2`
    p2.then( function(v){
        console.log( v );	// 42
    });
    ```

    Now what if you wanna delay the successive Promise in chain? It's the case if any promise fullfillment callback perfoming async task and successive chained promise depend on that.

    ```js
    function delay(time){
        return Promise(function(resolve,reject){
            setTimeout(resolve,time);
        })
    }

    delay( 100 ) // step 1
        .then( function STEP2(){
            console.log( "step 2 (after 100ms)" );
            return delay( 200 );
        } )
        .then( function STEP3(){
            console.log( "step 3 (after another 200ms)" );
        } )
        .then( function STEP4(){
            console.log( "step 4 (next Job)" );
            return delay( 50 );
        } )
        .then( function STEP5(){
            console.log( "step 5 (after another 50ms)" );
        } )
    ```

    For instance we have multiple api's which are dependent on each other in terms of response. Then simply return a promise from fullfillment/resolution callback which resolve when api response recieved.

    ```js
    function request(url){
        return new Promise(function(resolve){
            // ajax doesn't return promise, that's why we wrap it inside promise
            ajax(url,resolve);
        })
    }

    request('https://abc-scd.....')
        .then(function(response1){
            return request('https://another-api....'+ response1);
        })
        .then(function(response2){
            return request('https://another-api-abc....'+ response2);
        })
    ```

### DAY 7: Jan 25,2021 [Monday]

**Today's Progress:** Understand the Promise patterns.

**Thought:** Promise patterns in Javascript are helper methods provided by Promise API to ease the task according to requirment and neeed. We can create our own custom Patterns too. Now I'll lay out some patterns that today I learn as well some gotchas.

1. **Promise.all([..])**

   * It uses the *gate pattern* means gate will only unlocked if all of the parallel/concurrent tasks get completed.

   * It takes the list of promises and returns the single promise that only fulfill if all of the promises in array get fulfilled, if any of the promise get rejected then main Promise returned by `Promise.all` get rejected too.

   * `Promise.all()` on fulfillment return the array of completion values of all array fulfilled promises.

        ```js
        //Main promise fulfillment case

        let p1 = Promise.resolve(19);
        let p2 = Promise.resolve(90);

        Promise.all([p1,p2,p3])
        .then(function(vals){
            console.log(vals); // [19,20]
        })
        .catch(function((err){
            console.error(err);
        })
        ```

        ```js
        //Main promise rejection case

        let p1 = Promise.resolve(19);
        let p2 = Promise.resolve(90);
        let p3 = Promise.reject(47);

        //Because of p3 the main promise get rejected too
        Promise.all([p1,p2,p3])
        .then(function(vals){
            console.log(vals); // [19,20]
        })
        .catch(function((err){
            console.error(err);
        })
        ```

    * If we pass empty array, then `Promise.all()` fulfilled immediately.

      ```js
        Promise.all([])
            .then(function(resolve){
                console.log("Success");
            })
      ```

1. **Promise.race([..])**

   * Unlike `Promise.all()` it resolve if any of the promise in the array get resolved first, either rejected or completed.

   * Now their is a special case if all of the promises in the array resolve the immediate value, then the main promise will resolve for first promises fulfillment value in array. *It's not a practical case but still worth to remeber*.For instance see below code snippet.

        ```js
        //Special case for immediate values

        let p1 = Promise.resolve(19);
        let p2 = Promise.resolve(90);
        let p3 = Promise.reject(47);

        // Main promise will resolved for
        // first immediate value i.e p1
        Promise.all([p1,p2,p3])
        .then(function(vals){
            console.log(vals); // 19
        })
        .catch(function((err){
            console.error(err);
        })

        p1 = Promise.resolve(23);
        p2 = Promise.resolve(32);
        p3 = Promise.reject(43);

        //Now main promise get rejected
        Promise.all([p3,p2,p1])
        .then(function(vals){
            console.log(vals);
        })
        .catch(function((err){
            console.error(err);
        })
        ```
    * Other key point to remeber never pass an empty array to `Promise.race([])` because it will never resolve.

        ```js
        // This promise will never resolve...
        Promise.all([])
        .then(function(){
            console.log('Success');
        })
        ```

1. **Finally**

   * Now here we are, if in any case you want to perform some action either promise fulfilled or rejected then you can register `.finally()` event on promise instance and even chain them too on `.then()`.

        ```js
        let p = Promise.resolve( 42 );

        p
        .then( something )
        .finally( cleanup )
        .then( another )
        .finally( cleanup );
        ```

### DAY 8: JAN 26,2021 [Tuesday]

**Today's Progress:** Played with giphy api.

**Thought:** Create a small demo app that fetches the gifs using giphy api and also allow user to search specific gifs. When reading about API get to know about fetch API that according to me should be used instead of XHR request. The reason is it provides promise and as we all know handling API stuff using Promise API is quite handy.

**Resouces:**

### DAY 9: JAN 27,2021 [Wednesday]

**Today's Progress:** Create a small project using giphy api.

**Thought:** All though the main logic of app was already implemented yesterday. But today mostly implemented the ui and done some code refactoring. Now the app is ready to give a glimpse to it.

**Demo:**

### DAY 10: JAN 28,2021 [Thursday]

**Today's Progress:** Read about await async pattern in JavaScript.

**Thought:** Async await pattern in JavaScript is syntactical sugar to Promise. So why we should use async await pattern instead of promise. Let see

- Maintain code flow.
- Synchronous looking code means it generally makes you asynchronous code to look like synchronous code.

Below is **async** function syntax. async signify two things.

- This function behave asynchronously.
- Return promise.

    ```js
    async function foo(){
        //do asynchronous task...
    }

    foo(); //return promise
    ```

    Whenver we explicitly return something from function then promise get resolved. For example

    ```js
    async function foo(){
        //do asynchronous task...
        return 1; // resolved promise.
    }

    foo();
    ```

**await** keyword is written before Promise and act as replacemnt for `.then()` in promise. It can only be used inside *async function*.

- *await* means `pause until done`. JavaScript Engine pause exection inside function until promise written after *await* settled.

  ```js
    async function foo(){
        //Here JavaScript engine pause execution until promise is resolved
        await new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
            setTimeout(resolve,3000);
        });
        //After 3seconds when promise resolved javsacript engine execute next line
        console.log("Keep Going");
    }

    foo()
  ```

### DAY 11: JAN 29,2021 [Friday]

**Today's Progress:** Begin to work on new project i.e a weather app.

**Thought:** Learn some few concepts of async await pattern from which I get to know about micro task event queue and simple event queue. After that created a new github repo for weather app project on which I'm working. Now Yesterday forget to mention one thing i.e we can handle global Promise rejection using `unhandledrejection` event.

```js
Promise.reject(Error("Catch me!! I don't have my own catch block"));

window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection',function(event){
    console.log('Oh I will catch you promise ' + event.promise);
    console.log('You got that error ' + event.reason);
});
```

### DAY 12: JAN 30,2021 [Saturday]

**Today's Progress:** Integrate OpenWather API.

**Thought:** Yesterday I had started a new project i.e. a weather app to hone my skills about API integration, how it's design, implementatin bla bla... Today get to understand some basic concepts like *resources*, *endpoints* and some other stuffs. Now integrate the openWeather API and prints its response to console. By tomorrow will complete this project.

**Resources:**

### DAY 13: JAN 31,2021 [Sunday]

**Today's Progress:** Worked on UI of my weather app.

**Thought:** Today I worked on UI part of my weather app. I think writing css is more difficult that writing js code. But working on that, by tomorrow surely it will complete and make a release.


### DAY 14: FEB 1,2021 [Monday]

**Today's Progress:** Release the app.

**Thought:** Really slaute to frontend developers who creat a whole short animation video using HTML5/CSS3 only. According to me fronend basic is versy easy but its specialization is not child's play. Let's come to the point today before pushing code to github I had hard reset my git HEAD to previous commit and all my changes gone. But I able to recover them using `git reflog` command. From this incident came to know git also maintain a backup directory because of which I'm able to recover my files. So in the last make a first release of the project. Below is the project live verison.

**Demo:**
https://coderoo7.github.io/weather-app/


### DAY 15: FEB 2,2021 [Tuesday]

**Today's Progress:** Add some new functionality to weather app.

**Thought:** Done some UI changes and add other functionality to change the weather app background according to current weather condition of searched city. Then update the portfolio to enlist my new projects. That's how the today spend.

**Demo:**
https://coderoo7.github.io/weather-app/


### DAY 16: FEB 3,2021 [Wednesday]

**Today's Progress:** Started react.

**Thought:** Read about why react should be used, what react is and some other stuff. After reading some articles understand that

- React is a client side UI library that can be used with any tech stack which has it's big advantage over it's competitors like Vue and Angular.
- React has two building blocks i.e

  1. Components: A component can be described as independent unit of your web page like navbar, footer etc. Component can be define using two ways either function or class. Basically component maintain their own state because of that our application become loosely coupled which allow us to write flexible and reusable code. `The good code is one which is easy to delete` and that rule react follows very well.

    ```js
    //Class Component
    class Welcome extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
        }
    }

    // Functional Component
    function Welcome(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
    }
    ```
  2. Elements: These are your html like syntax elements but in actual they follow JSX syntax or we can say they are JSX elements not HTML nor string. These are elements that are rendered to DOM using `REACTDOM` library.

    ```js
        // element is JSX entity
        const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
    ```

### DAY 17: FEB 4,2021 [Thursday]

**Today's Progress:** Play with react.

**Thought:** Learn to do basic react-setup and clear some concepts about JSX elements.

- **So what is the purpose of JSX, why we use it ?**
  JSX holy purpose is to enable to write HTML markup in Javascript.
  Now internally after compilation JSX expressions become javscript function calls. Means at last theses HTML like looking elements actually transpile to javasript code. That's why JSX is coined as Javascript Extension.

  ```js
    //This el is JSX element
    const el  = <h1>Hi their</h1>

    //After compilation it will transpile to following function
    React.createElement("<h1>Hi their</h1>",{},null);
  ```

  For more understanding checkout this [React without JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html).
  <br>

- **What is pure function ?**
  Pure simply means for given input you always get same output and **input never modifies**. Now using this concept in react is that props(object with user defined properties) that we pass to  children component are **immutable** means read only.

  In other terms props can't be modified because that they always produce same output means props are pure.

  ```js
  //pure function always have same output for same input
  const add = (a,b) => a+b;

  let arr = [0,8,8,-1,1]

  //Now here, foo is impure function as it modify our input
  function foo(arr){
      for(let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
          arr[i] += 1;
      }
  }

  foo();
  console.log(arr) //[1,9,9,0,2]
  ```


### DAY 18: FEB 5,2021 [Friday]

**Today's Progress:** Understand concept of state and props in React.

**Thought:** Today again read more about react stuff & get in details about states and props in react. Some important points that I have grab are like this

- **So why we pass props to constructor of child component?**
  If you don't pass props to constructor than your `this.pops.somProperty` will be undefined if you use it inside constructor.
  Note: `this.props` will be define inside of other methods like render() regardless of whether you pass props to super() or not.
  <br>

    ```js
    import React, {Component} from "react";
    import ReactDom from "react-dom";

    class ParentComponent extends Component{

        //Not using constructor here no need.

        /* constructor(props){
            super(props);
        } */

        clickBtn(){
            console.log("How dare you to click me ?");
        }

        render(){
            return(

                <ChildComponent onButtonClicked={this.clickBtn}/>
            )
        }
    }

    ReactDom.render(<ParentComponent />, document.getElementById("root"));
    ```

    ```js
    import React, {Component} from "react";

    class ChildComponent extends Component{

        constructor(props){
            console.log("Before super(props)",props); //here props will be undefined.
            super(props);
            console.log("After super(props)",props); // here props will be define.
        }

        render(){
            // Event if you don't pass props to super, props will be define.
            return(
                <h1>Child Component</h1>
                <button onClick={this.props.onButtonClicked}>Click Me!!</button>
            )
        }
    }
    ```

- **Why we bind `this` to function of Class Component ?**
  If we don't bind this to function then it's context will be undefined when you pass that function as a props to chidComponent. Here *context* refer to the class in which function is define.

  Now considering previous code snippet, I had only console statement to `clickBtn()`function.Now when you click on the button `this` will be undefined.

   ```js
    .....

    class ParentComponent extends Component{

        //Not using constructor here no need.

        /* constructor(props){
            super(props);
        } */

        clickBtn(){
            //New statement
            console.log(this);
            console.log("How dare you to click me ?");
        }

        render(){
            return(
                <ChildComponent onButtonClicked={this.clickBtn}/>
            )
        }
    }
    ....

    ```

   Now let see after binding `this` what happened...

    ```js
    .....

    class ParentComponent extends Component{


        constructor(props){
            super(props);
            // here we are binding the context of function.
            this.clickBtn = this.clickBtn.bind(this);
        }

        clickBtn(){
            //New statement
            console.log(this); // some Object
            console.log("How dare you to click me ?");
        }

        render(){
            return(
                <ChildComponent onButtonClicked={this.clickBtn}/>
            )
        }
    }
    ....

    ```

    On seeing value on console you will understand the difference.

- **Now the concept of State**
  Each component in react maintain it's own state which private to component itself. In case you want to update some variable values whose output you want to render on UI in that you have to use `state` in react.

  `state:{}` it's simply an object with user defined properties. Let see through example.

  ```js
    import React, { Component } from "react";

    class App extends Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            //Setting inital values here
            this.state = {
            count: 0,
            };

            this.countUp = this.countUp.bind(this);
        }

        countUp() {
            //UI will not update
            this.state.count += 1;
            console.log("count"+this.state.count);
        }

        render() {
            return (
            <div>
                <button onClick={this.countUp}>Click Me!</button>
                <p>{this.state.count}</p>
            </div>
            );
        }
    }
  ```

  If you click on button you will notice that in console you will able to see count updated value but UI is not updating.
  For that case we always updated variable value using `setState()` method. Because on each call of `setState()` your dom is re-rendered or you can say updated.

   ```js
    import React, { Component } from "react";

    class App extends Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            //Setting inital values here
            this.state = {
            count: 0,
            };

            this.countUp = this.countUp.bind(this);
        }

        countUp() {
            //Now your UI will update too...
            this.setState({
                count: this.state.count + 1,
            });
            console.log("count"+this.state.count);
        }

        render() {
            return (
            <div>
                <button onClick={this.countUp}>Click Me!</button>
                <p>{this.state.count}</p>
            </div>
            );
        }
    }
  ```

### Day 19: FEB 6,2021 [Saturday]

**Today's Progress:** Integrate babel with webpack.

**Thoughts:** Today I got stuck on some error while integrating babel with webpack in my todo-list project and most of the time was spent in fixing that error.


### Day 20: FEB 7,2021 [Sunday]

**Today's Progress:** Begin to work on todo task sample app.

**Thoughts:** Today I think to move forward to implement what I have learn upto now. So able to do some basic stuffs in my todo task app. After modifying it little bit will begin to work on my `uttamcv` project.


### Day 21: FEB 8,2021 [Monday]

**Today's Progress:** Work on my todo Task react app.

**Thoughts:** Today I get myself indulge in fixing bugs. Then implement basic todo create and edit functionality in app and some ui changes.


### Day 22: FEB 9,2021 [Tuesday]

**Today's Progress:** Like yesterday today also work on my react todo app.

**Thoughts:** So I had spent most of my time around 3 to 4 hours on a bug which is actually not a bug but silly mistake by me while writing the code. After that get another bug which surprisingly new to me and I'm still not able to understand what is the cause of this properly. But somehow I get work around it and it get fixed using another approach.

Trying to explain the bug using example.

```js
 class App extends React.Component{
     constructor(){
         super();

         this.state = {
             task:{},
             tasks: [
                 {
                    id: 1,
                    title: "100DaysOfCode",
                    isCompleted: false,
                 },
                 {
                    id: 2,
                    title: "Full Stack Developer",
                    isCompleted: false,
                 },
                 {
                    id: 3,
                    title: "Successful Person",
                    isCompleted: false,
                 }
             ],
         }

         this.toggleTaskCompletion1 = this.toggleTaskCompletion1.bind(this);
         this.toggleTaskCompletion2 = this.toggleTaskCompletion2.bind(this);
     }

    // using this approach my tasks array get never updated don't understand why
     toggleTaskCompletion1(id){

        //setState is asynchronous but here I'm using updater function which gurantee to update
        //the value but still my taskCompletion state didn't change....
        this.setState((prevState)=>{
            return{
                tasks: prevState.tasks.map((task)=>{
                    if(task.id === id){
                        task.isCompleted = !task.isCompleted,
                    }
                    return task
                });
            }
        })
     }

    // using this approach task completion state update.
     toggleTaskCompletion2(id){
        // here first I'm synchrounously get the array with updated value.
        const tasks = prevState.tasks.map((task)=>{
                        if(task.id === id){
                            task.isCompleted = !task.isCompleted,
                        }
                        return task
                      });
        // then this array is used to change the state...
        this.setState((prevState)=>{
            return{
                tasks,
            }
        });
     }

     render(){
         toggleTaskCompletion1(1); //Doesn't update
         toggleTaskCompletion2(1); //Does update

         return(
             <h1>Be happy :)</h1>
         );
     }
 }

```

### Day 23: FEB 10,2021 [Wednesday]

**Today's Progress:** App ready for beta release.

**Thoughts:** Today done with all UI changes and functionality that want to implement. Main task was to handle user data for which I have implemented a local storage. Now tomorrow will try to convert this react web app into chrome extension and if everything works fine then tomorrow will make a beta release of todoroll chrome extension.


### Day 24: FEB 11,2021 [Thursday]

**Today's Progress:** Test the extension in chrome and firefox browser.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday I thought of uploading the extension to chrome web store. But it has a $5 fee. And I didn't knew then I visit firefox store and they don't have any fee to upload add-on to their store. But get stuck on a step. I think it should be fix by tomorrow and may be share my first browser extension public link.

Today learn a handy command of git to make an archive of latest commit. i.e.

```bash
git archive -o filename.zip HEAD
```
Advantage is that files mentioned in `.gitignore` automatically excluded.

**Resources:**
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/get_started_simple/

- https://dev.to/scleriot/build-a-firefox-extension-step-by-step-5dbl


### Day 25: FEB 12,2021 [Friday]

**Today's Progress:** Fix the timezone bug in firefox.

**Thoughts:** Today I get to know that firefox and chrome `new Date()` API return dateTime differently i.e firefox return in UTC while chrome return in LocalTimeZone. But I need to maintain localTimeZone for this fetching the localTimeZone based on client ip.


### Day 26: FEB 13,2021 [Saturday]

**Today's Progress:** Auto background image update functionality.

**Thoughts:** After fixing the timeZone bug I began to work on implementing functionality to auto update the background image based on daytime. Being honest today didn't done much work that's why only able to implement that auto background image functionality. In short today also not able to launch firefox extension.


### Day 27: FEB 14,2021 [Sunday]

**Today's Progress:** Build script changes.

**Thoughts:** Fix some previous bugs and create a build to publish addon. But because of 504 Gateway error unable to publish it. But user can test it locally.


### Day 28: FEB 15,2021 [Monday]

**Today's Progress:** Update readme.md and refactor the code.

**Thoughts:** I think instead of lazy loading images in react, it's better to use static asset urls for images in production build. Today also getting 504 gateway error on publish the addon, so I had created a launch script so that user can install & test extension in browser locally.

**Resources:**

### Day 29: FEB 16,2021 [Tuesday]

**Today's Progress:** Began to work on my cv project.

**Thoughts:** Most of the time spend in setting up tailwind from scratch in my react template. But effort was not in vain, by setting up things from scratch able to clear more concepts related to post-css and learn some new tweaks. Now from tomorrow will began to implement the logic and UI part of the app.

**Resources:**

- https://codewithnico.com/production-ready-react-apps/
- https://dev.to/hagnerd/setting-up-tailwind-with-create-react-app-4jd


### Day 30: FEB 17,2021 [Wednesday]

**Today's Progress:** Design UI of components.

**Thoughts:** Only worked on designing the components today. Few components still remain, then will implement logic part. I think by tomorrow all components UI rendering may be done. That's all about today.


### Day 31: FEB 18,2021 [Thursday]

**Today's Progress:** Integrate two component in app.

**Thoughts:** After completing UI design of components today begin to integrate them. Now the problem is that I have to maintain and store the state of each component that I'm going to integrate. The previous project was small. But in this project I'm taking the input from user in different forms means different component. Now need to maintain a single state for all components & I don't know how to manage that part without using redux. But let see if redux is required than will use it.


### Day 32: FEB 19,2021 [Friday]

**Today's Progress:** Optimize webpack build performance.while using it

**Thoughts:** The issue was that whenever I do single change in css property than webpack dev server rebuild the entire app and because of tailwind it was taking around 1 minute to build. So I began to google about how I can optimize webpack build performance, then came to know if we maintain cache then it really improve the build performance. Then after doing some tweaks I'm able to imporve build performance. Initial build take time, but after that it works fine.


### Day 33: FEB 20,2021 [Saturday]

**Today's Progress:** Learn to setup docker.

**Thoughts:** Today learn to setup docker for a project on which I'm going to work and may be for a while giving pause to my `uttamcv` project on which I was working. So in this project I have to made a Loan Management System for which I'm going to use `MERN` stack. Let see how much time it will take. After getting familiar with docker and gets my hand dirty while working on it. Then done some changes in my `react-webpack-starter` template to optimize webpack performance and some linting tweaks.

**Resouces:**

- https://serversforhackers.com/c/getting-started-with-docker


### Day 34: FEB 21, 2021 [Sunday]

**Today's Progress:** Learn to setup docker-compose file.

**Thoughts:** So today begin to work on new project, but will try to complete my `uttamcv` project side by side. By following a blog article I have setup my initial frontend, backend stucture for my project. Setting the timeline for this week to complete this project. I hope so it get completed.  

**Resources:**

- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-fullstack-react-express-mongodb-app-using-docker-c3e3e21c4074/


### Day 35: FEB 22, 2021 [Monday]

**Today's Progress:** Refactor the code.

**Thoughts:** The reason I refactor the code or you can say project structure because I want to seperate the backend and frontend code such that they can deploy on different servers. As usual you see monolithic repo in which client and server code are in same directory because of that they can't be deploy on different platforms. I use 3 tier stucture for project which is about decoupling of frontend and backend code. Now the app can be run locally as well as using docker container. From tomorrow will begin to implement auth API for login & resgisteration of user.

**Resources:**

- https://alligator.io/react/mern-stack-intro/


### Day 36: FEB 23, 2021 [Tuesday]

**Today's Progress:** Learn to implement schema in mongoose.

**Thoughts:** After implement schema for user, I want to test the user model without using api. Then I groped many articles and found one in which author explain to use `mongo in memory db` using jest library to define & run test cases. Now `mongo in memory db` is just a mongod process that takes around 7mb of ram and create database in main memory instead of persistance storage. That's all what I learn tomorrow will complete the user auth api.

### Day 37: FEB 24, 2021 [Wednesday]

**Today's Progress:** Integrate login and signup API.

**Thoughts:** Although I had integrated the api's the important thing that remain to generate authentication user token. After implementing authentication token logic will work on client side to setup login and signup form.

### Day 38: FEB 25, 2021 [Thursday]

**Today's Progress:** generate auth token for user.

**Thoughts:** Only implement the logic for generating auth access token for user. Also implement the logic for handling user roles and made new api to fetch all users that can only be access by admin. Now somehow handling the user role but may be that's not the modular approach that I'm using for right now.

### Day 39: FEB 26,2021 [Friday]

**Today's Progress:** Changes in api response.

**Thoughts:** Today was reading about good api design practices and came to know few key points that

* Api endpoints should be noun instread of verbes
* Either use plural or singular nouns for api, whatever you choose maintain the same structure throught the app.
* There are other some key concepts but the best one is to implement cache functionality in api. If you have ever seen `e-tag` in api response that means api support caching functionality.

### Day 43: MAR 02,2021 [Tuesday]

**Today's Progress:** Refactor the code.

**Thoughts:** Today I have refactor the yesterday code, fix logout bug & done some changes in my build scripts. One new thing I learn is to implement run time validation for props. Also read about refs in form. But yet don't know is it good to use it or not. That's all about today.
  
```js
    import React, {Component} from 'react';
    import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
    
    class Parent extends Component {
        // you code
        
        <Children name="Shubham" occupation="React Developer">
    }

    class Children extends Component {
        // your code
    }
    
    // props validation
    Children.propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired
        occupation: PropTypes.string.isRequired
    }
```

### Day 44: MAR 03,2021 [Wednesday]

**Today's Progress:** Implement loading UI component.

**Thoughts:** Not able to catch much, watched some react youtube videos to clear concepts and trust me those videos are really great. And implement a small functionality to show loading UI to user until api request completed.

### Day 45: MAR 04,2021 [Thursday]

**Today's Progress:** Learn about Error Boundary in react.

**Thoughts:** Today I was busy in doing some other stuff, because of that not able to cover much but yet I have learn to implement Error Boundary in react to prevent app crash. It's a useful feature implemented in react v16 to prevent app crash and provide a fallback ui to user in case error occur in any component.
